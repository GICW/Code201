# Lecture: JS Debugging Workflow

- check browser console & resolve all error messages
  - look at file name, line number of error, and error type
- check for useful linter messages near the source of the error
- console log the value you are trying to work with
- note all of the places in your code that define or modify the value you are working with
- try commenting things out, then adding them back. work backward until you find the first source of error
- try calling functions or inspecting vars in console
  - is the value named correctly?
  - is the value defined?
  - is the value the right type?
  - does the object have the props/methods you expect?
  - does the function return the value(s) it should?
  - are you calling the function with the right number/type of arguments?
  - does the array have the number/type of elements you expect?
- inspect the HTML elements
  - do all the elements exist in the HTML?
  - is the HTML hierarchy correct?
  - does the element actually have an event listener attached?
  - does the element have all the attributes you expect?
  - have you mixed up a class & an ID?
