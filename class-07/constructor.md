### Constructor functions

- **Why**
  - Constructor functions are used to initialize objects with the default or initial state.
- **What**
  - A constructor is a function used to create object instances.
- **How**
  - Use a tool like Replit or VSCode to demo constructors.
  - Breakdown the anatomy of a constructor and how the syntax differs from object literals.
  - Explain how the term `this` differs with constructors.

### Prototypes

- **Why**
  - With prototypes, the objects created by the constructor function will inherit methods and properties.
- **What**
  - A method that will be available to all objects instanciated by the constructor function.
- **How**
  - Demonstrate the difference between adding a method to a created object vs a prototype method to the constructor.

### HTML tables

- **Why**
  - Tables are a great way to render data to the page.
- **What**
  - HTML tables consist of the `<table>` element and one or more `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` elements.
- **How**
  - Demonstrate a quick table add in the HTML file.
  - Then demonstrate how the students will need to render their tables for lab using JavaScript.
 
## Lab Notes

For this lab, students will be refactoring all of their object literals for the cookie stores into a single constructor function with multiple instances. The second component of this lab is to convert their list elements from the previous lab's work into a table that is dynamically rendered to the DOM from their JavaScript file.

All of the methods for the constructor function should be inherited using its `.prototype` property.
